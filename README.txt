Shape.c / .h: file that manage all shapes, including numbers and letters.
Number.c / .h: file that defines all numbers in 3D.
Alphabet.c / .h: file that defines all letters in 3D.
BaseShape.c / h: file that consists basic shape such as box and ring that is used by Number.c and Alphabet.c.

*** Display control ***
z: zoom out
x: zoom in
right key: orbit camera to right direction
left key: orbit camera to left direction
up key: orbit camera upward
down key: orbit camera downward

*** Display description ***
Currently, it is slightly hard to distinguish where they are 3D or not when initial display popsup because there is no light at the moment. But, it is easy to find that it is 3D once you move the camera around.
